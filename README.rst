Introduction
------------
Poio is a collection of software tools for linguists working in language
documentation, descriptive linguistics and/or language typology. It allows
linguists to manage and analyze their data. The Poio Interlinear Editor allows
to add morpho-syntactic and other annotations to transcriptions. It supports
various file formats for input, but will only output standardized XML defined
by the Corpus Encoding Standard and the Text Encoding Initiative. Several
tools for analyzing linguistic data will be made available to further process
annotated data. Poio tools are written in Python and are based on PyQt.
